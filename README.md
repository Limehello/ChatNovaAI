ChatNovaAI is an intelligent chatbot built using Java and DeepLearning4J. It aims to provide users with engaging conversations and assist with various queries using natural language processing and machine learning techniques.

## Features

- Natural language understanding
- Contextual conversation handling
- Customizable responses based on user input
- Deep learning model for improved performance

## Technologies Used

- Java
- DeepLearning4J
- Maven
- Natural Language Processing (NLP)
- Unit Testing with JUnit

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- Java Development Kit (JDK) 8 or higher
- Apache Maven
- An IDE (like IntelliJ IDEA or Eclipse)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
